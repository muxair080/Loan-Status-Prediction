# Loan-Status-Prediction
This is loan status prediction project. I have trained different classical ml models on loan status dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ninzaami/loan-predication?select=train_u6lujuX_CVtuZ9i+%281%29.csv . I have trained difffernt models on this data set like logistc, 
SVM, Decission tree, Random forest and ada boost. First of all I have cleaned this dataset then replace the null values by median of the column after that i have changed
the char features to numeric features and also vissulize the different features of the dataset after that i split the data into training and testing data then i 
trained the above mentioned models on data.
